## Opinion change

| Original Claim | Supported by | Process -> | TRPG Claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Role-playing the genuine defense of a case, with a lot of improvisation and being satisfied with his own performance, can change my opinion on this case better than a lecture. | (Janis & King 1954) P CX R+ E PR 0.99 | Transfer | If I roleplay a character with an another point of view than mine, with enough agency and playfullness, I can undestand better this point of view (compare to a lecture on the subject).|
